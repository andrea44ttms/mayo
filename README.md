# Mayo 🦾🤖
### The Autonomous Triple-AI Maintainer

Mayo is a **Self-Improving Autonomous Maintenance Engine** integrated directly into your GitHub ecosystem. It uses a **Triple-AI Pipeline** — three specialized AI models working in concert — to produce high-value, validated code improvements across all your repositories.

> **Personal fork note:** I'm using this to experiment with the Triple-AI pipeline on my own projects. Main changes from upstream will be tracked in this README.

## 🧬 Triple-AI Pipeline

Every improvement goes through 3 AI models before it becomes a PR:

| Role | Model(s) Used | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 🔭 **Scanner** | Fireworks AI (Llama 3.3 70B), Gemini 2.5 Flash | Reads full codebase → text-only analysis (zero compaction risk) |
| ⚡ **Executor** | Fireworks AI (Llama 3.3 70B), Groq (Llama 3.1 8B), Gemini 2.5 Flash | Receives plan → produces surgical search/replace edits |
| 🛡️ **Reviewer** | Gemini 2.5 Flash | Validates edits, corrects mistakes, audits PR review history |
| 🆕 **NewCrons** | Fireworks AI (Llama 3.3 70B), Gemini 2.5 Flash | Handles timed phases (PR/issue judging, proactive issues, discussions) |

## 🧠 Cross-Repo Global Memory

Unlike standard AI bots, Mayo has **persistent memory**:
- Tracks successes, failures, and "lessons learned" across all repositories.
- Insights from Repo A directly improve work on Repo B.
- The Reviewer audits real PR states (merged/closed/commented) and updates memory automatically.

---

## 🩺 Surgical Precision

The Executor uses a **Search/Replace block system** (max 10 lines per block). This guarantees:
- **100% preservation** of your original code structure.
- **Zero hallucination** of unrelated code.
- **Validated PRs** — every edit is reviewed by the Reviewer before creation.

---

## 🏗️ Analysis Depth

The Scanner performs a rigorous multi-layered analysis:
1. **Security**: Injections, hardcoded secrets, missing validation
2. **Logic**: Edge cases, null checks, error handling
3. **DX**: Missing READMEs, build guides, setup docs
4. **Performance**: Redundant calls, memory leaks
5. **Consistency**: Naming, patterns, style
6. **Creative**: Proactive "expert touches"
